# Molveno-Restaurant-system
Repository for the development of the Restaurant system for the Molveno resort

# EPIC for the project:
We envision building a restaurant system for Molveno Lake Resort that comprises of two main parts, one for the guests and one for restaurant staff (manager, kitchen staff, floor staff). For the guests we will provide the possibility to book a table from outside the restaurant and create a fully independent system for seeing the menu card and placing orders without the need for restaurant staff that will be accessible at the restaurant by scanning a QR-code. For the restaurant staff we will create a system that will allow them to manage inventory, pricing, recipes, the menu-card and ordering.
